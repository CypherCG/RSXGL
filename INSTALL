RSXGL uses the GNU autotools for its build system and is distributed
with a configure script. It requires the following projects:

* [ps3toolchain](http://github.com/ps3dev/ps3toolchain)
* [PSL1GHT](http://github.com/ps3dev/PSL1GHT

NVIDIA's cgc shader compiler, from the Cg toolkit, is also required to
use vertex and fragment GPU programs.

The RSXGL library depends upon a toolchain that can generate binaries for the
PS3's PPU, and also upon parts of the PSL1GHT SDK. The sample programs also
require a few ported libraries, such as libpng, which are provided by
the ps3toolchain project. ps3toolchain recommends setting two
environment variables to locate these dependencies:

	export PS3DEV=/usr/local/ps3dev
	export PSL1GHT=$PS3DEV

RSXGL's configure script will use these environment variables if
they're set; if they aren't set, by default the script uses the above
settings. The PORTLIBS environment variable may also be set to further
control were the ported libraries can be found.

Anyway if these variables are set reasonably, then the following
commands should build RSXGL and its samples:

	 ./configure --prefix=/location/of/rsxgl
	 make
	 make install

(Sample programs are packaged into NPDRM packages, but those packages
remain in their build locations; they don't get moved anywhere
relative to RSXGL's install path).

By default, configure will create non-debug builds with low
optimization settings (-O1). Other options are:

         # Debug build, including assertions:
	 ./configure --enable-debug

	 # Optimized build (-O3):
	 ./configure --enable-ppu-optimize

The locations of the library's dependencies can be specified on the configure
command-line, too:

	./configure \
	  --with-ps3dev=/usr/local/ps3dev \
 	  --with-psl1ght=/usr/local/ps3dev/libpsl1ght \
	  --with-portlibs=/usr/local/ps3dev/portlibs

The configure expects to find versions of the gcc, g++, ar, ranlib,
and ld programs that target the PS3's PPU. It tries to find these in
$PS3DEV/ppu/bin, but the following environment variables can be set to
provide full paths to these programs to the configure script:

	PPU_CC	      Location of C compiler
	PPU_CXX	      Location of C++ compiler
	PPU_AR	      Location of the ar archive utility
	PPU_RANLIB    Location of the ranlib utility
	PPU_LD	      Location of the ld linker

The following environment variables can also be set to further
influence how headers and libraries are located:

	PS3DEV_PPU_CPPFLAGS
	PS3DEV_PPU_LDFLAGS
	PSL1GHT_PPU_CPPFLAGS
	PSL1GHT_PPU_LDFLAGS
	PORTLIBS_PPU_CPPFLAGS
	PORTLIBS_PPU_LDFLAGS

Currently two sample programs are built:

* src/samples/rsxgltest - A very simple test program whose contents and
behavior will vary. This program is mainly used to try out various
features of the library as they are developed.

* src/samples/rsxglgears - A port of an old chestnut, the "glgears"
program that uses OpenGL to render some spinning gears. This port is
based upon a version included in the Mesa library, which was itself a
port to OpenGL ES 2 after being handed down throughout the ages.

The sample can print debugging information over TCP, in the manner of
PSL1GHT's network/debugtest sample. src/samples/rsxgltest/main.c has
symbols called TEST_IP and TESTPORT which specify the IP address and
port number to try to connect to, and you can use "nc -l portnum" to
receive messages.
