RSXGL - The RSX Graphics Library

This library implements parts of the OpenGL 3.1 core profile specification for
the PlayStation 3's RSX GPU. It's suitable for use in programs that
have exclusive access to the RSX, such as GameOS software (and is likely
unsuitable for implementing a multitasking desktop, as the library
doesn't arbitrate access to the RSX).

Please see the [STATUS file](STATUS) for up-to-date information about the
current capabilities of this library.
