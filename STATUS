Briefly, the following OpenGL 3.1 features haven't been implemented
yet (the RSX is capable of supporting most of them):

* Full GLSL support. Currently, GLSL and Cg shaders can be compiled offline and
  used with a OpenGL ES 2 style API.
* Instanced draw commands.
* Framebuffer objects.
* A variety of capabilities related to texture maps (rectangular and
  cube textures, the behavior of glPixelStore, copying from the
  framebuffer, and texture formats that require conversion and/or
  swizzling).
* Client-side vertex array data. OpenGL 3.1's core profile
  specifically omits this, but it is specified by OpenGL ES 2 (as well
  as the OpenGL 3 compatibility profile), and is likely still widely
  used, particularly by smaller demonstration programs.
* Application object namespaces (another feature omitted by OpenGL
  3.1, but used by earlier specs).
* Most glGet*() functions haven't been implemented.
