assimp autoconf-based build system

The files in this directory are for building the Open Asset Import
Library ("assimp") in a way that it can be used with RSXGL's glassview
example. The build system expects that the assimp source is located
elsewhere; please see glassview's README for more information. It
builds a library called libassimp.a

During development I found that linking to & calling the assimp
library caused glassview to hang before its main() function was even
reached. assimp likely suffers from the C++ "static initialization
fiasco," so I removed the importers that obviously initialized global
objects of non-trivial types, which resolved the problem (assimp has
so far been an otherwise excellent library to use).
