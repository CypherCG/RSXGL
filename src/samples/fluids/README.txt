This example implements Jos Stam's Stable Fluids, described here:

http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/ns.pdf

...and based upon an implementation found here:

http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~sco590/downloads/CDROM_GDC03.zip

Use the left-side stick to move the pointer around the screen. Push
the cross to add density to the fluid. Push the triangle to apply
force, in the direction of the most recent pointer movement.

Ideally, the simulation would be run on the PS3's SPU's.
